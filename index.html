            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Ethan Lawrence, I am a US citizen residing in the state of Michigan. I am attending Grand Traverse Academy currently for my junior year. I am enrolled at Northwest Education Services Career-Tech Center for the Web and App Development class. I chose that course as it teaches about computers and their functions and capabilities. I plan after highschool to continue learning the capabilities of computers.
            <br><br>
                Outside of my academics I have circled myself with a group of online friends, as I have met them on the internet they live all over the US and can therefore only do things over that medium. Often we engage in video games, D&D, or general presence.
