                I struggle to sleep. In the, <a href="goals.html">SMART Goals</a> section, you will see that it is already a goal of mine to fix this problem. Due to this, I have problems in the morning and at night both relating to failure to sleep. This has caused an equal distaste for both times of day as a routine stress that cannot be prevented, or can be but would cause larger problems later. This has brought me to be a night owl, as I pull desperately from the knowledge that when I head to sleep my next several hours will be long and empty.
